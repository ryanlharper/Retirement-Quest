# Retirement Quest
Retirement Quest is a command-line application written in Python that calculates the return required to meet retirement goals and simulates random events that may occur along the way. The application can help users plan and prepare for their retirement by providing an idea of the return needed to achieve a goal and how much money needed to retire.

## Features
- Calculate the required returned needed for retirement based on user input
- Simulate random events, such as market crashes or unexpected expenses or income
- Display the result of the simulation, indicating whether the retirement goal was met or not

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## Future Development
- Develop a front-end interface for the application
- Add more options for customization of simulation parameters
- Improve the simulation model to provide more accurate predictions
- Option to save and load previous simulations

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the `retirement_quest.py` file: `python retirement_quest.py`
3. Follow the prompts to enter the necessary information for the retirement calculation and simulation.
